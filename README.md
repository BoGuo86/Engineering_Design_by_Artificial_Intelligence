# Engineering Design by Reinforcement Learning and Finite Element Analysis
This repository is an attempt to apply artificial intelligence algorithms for the purpose of engineering design of structural elements like aircraft components. More specifically I combine finite element analysis and reinforcement learning to produce optimal (in terms of strength and weight) structures.  

Please see manuals for the specifics of models and algorithms I use.
